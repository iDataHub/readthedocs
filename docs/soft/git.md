## Description
> Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

If you want to get started with `git`, you should know some basic [terminology](https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary/terminology). Then you can try [interactive git visualization](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching) to promote your `git` skill. There are many git tutorials, and many of them are systematic goodies, so you can choose one or two from references according to your needs.
